        "description": "Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, originally published in 1865, was instantly loved by children and adults. The follow up work by Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass also proved to be extremely popular. \"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass\" is a unique and special LARGE PRINT version of both classics by Lewis Carroll. ** You get two books for the price of one! \"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass\" makes an ideal gift but it should also be a part of your own personal library. Please note that this limited edition printing includes some very special and unique drawings that are at once rare and beautiful. IMPORTANT! This is a perfect reproduction of Carroll's original works except that they have been converted into LARGE PRINT for simple and easy reading. ** This is an excellent book for kids and grandparents!",

Set approximately a half year later than the previous book, Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by moving through a mirror into the world that she can see past it. Through the Looking-Glass incorporates such commended sections as \"Jabberwocky\" and \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\", and the scene including Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The mirror which enlivened Carroll remains showed in Charlton Kings. The characters of Hatta and Haigha (articulated as the English would have said \"hatter\" and \"rabbit\") show up, and are envisioned (by Sir John Tenniel, not via Carroll) to take after their Wonderland partners, the Hatter and the March Hare. Notwithstanding, Alice doesn't remember them in that capacity. Dinah, Alice's feline, additionally makes a return - this time with her two cats, Kitty (the dark one) and Snowdrop (the white one).",

Alice tells Kitty a story about \"Looking-Glass House,\" a magical world on the other side of the mirror where everything is backwards. Suddenly, Alice finds herself on the mantel piece. She walks through the mirror and she is in Looking-Glass House. She sees that she is in a room quite like her own, but slightly different. There are chessmen standing in pairs on the fireplace and Alice comes to the aid of the White Queen's daughter, Lily, but the chessmen seem to be unable to see her. She finds a poem called \"Jabberwocky\" which is complete nonsense and this frustrates her, and he decides to explore the rest of the house. She finds a magnificent garden and follows the path into the garden. Strangely, every time she follows the path through the garden, she ends up back at the door to the house. In her frustration, she wonders aloud about how to make her way through the garden and to her surprise, a Tiger-lily responds. The other flowers begin to speak, and a few of them are rude to Alice. She learns from the flowers the Red Queen is near and Alice goes to find her. When Alice meets the Red Queen she engages in a conversation. The Red Queen keeps correcting Alice's etiquette. Alice then notices a chess game being played and tells the Red Queen she would like to play. The Red Queen tells her she can be a White Pawn and if she makes it to the end of the game, Alice will become a queen.",
