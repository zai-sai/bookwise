The events are set shortly after the events in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and after Dorothy Gale's departure back to Kansas. The protagonist of the novel is an orphan boy called Tip. For as long as he can remember, Tip has been under the guardianship of a cruel Wicked Witch named Mombi and lives in the northern quadrant of Oz called Gillikin Country. Mombi has always been extremely mean and abusive to Tip. As Mombi is returning home one day, Tip plans to get revenge and frighten her with a wooden man he has made, with a large Jack-o'-lantern he carves for a head, thus naming him Jack Pumpkinhead. To Tip's dismay, Mombi is not fooled by this trick, and she takes this opportunity to demonstrate the new magical \"Powder of Life\" that she had just obtained from another sorcerer. Mombi tells Tip that she intends to transform him into a marble statue to punish him for his mischievous ways.L. FRANK BAUM OTHERS WORK AS FOLLOW1. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900)2.

Tip plans to get his revenge with a wooden man that he has made using a jack-o-lantern as a head. Unfortunately, the witch is not fooled and threatens to turn Tip into a statue using the Powder of Life. Rather than staying to be turned into a statue, Tip runs away after stealing the Powder of Life from Mombi, using it to animate a sawhorse for Jack to ride. Thus begins Tips adventures as he journeys to the Emerald City, escapes revolts, and learns just who the true ruler of Oz is.",
