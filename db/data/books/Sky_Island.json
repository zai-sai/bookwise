Frank Baum Lyman Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 - May 6, 1919) is one of America's most read authors, and he is widely considered one of the premier authors of children's books. Baum wrote dozens of novels and short stories, as well as hundreds of poems, and he even foresaw technological innovations such as computers, televisions and mobile phones, all of which made their way into his writing. Baum, however, is still best known and best regarded for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and several other titles that took place in the fantasy world of Oz. Every American is familiar with Dorothy and Toto, and Oz has been adapted for movies, screenplays, and more ever since.",

He lives at my house, too--the white house you see over there on the bluff.\" \"Oh; is that your home?\" \"Yes,\" said Trot, proudly. \"Isn't it pretty?\" \"It's pretty small, seems to me,\" answered the boy. \"But it's big enough for mother and me, an' for Cap'n Bill,\" said Trot. \"Haven't you any father?\" \"Yes, 'ndeed; Cap'n Griffith is my father; but he's gone, most of the time, sailin' on his ship. You mus' be a stranger in these parts, little boy, not to know 'bout Cap'n Griffith,\" she added, looking at her new acquaintance intently. Trot wasn't very big herself, but the boy was not quite as big as Trot. He was thin, with a rather pale complexion and his blue eyes were round and earnest. He wore a blouse waist, a short jacket and knickerbockers. Under his arm he held an old umbrella that was as tall as he was. Its covering had once been of thick brown cloth, but the color had faded to a dull drab, except in the creases, and Trot thought it looked very old-fashioned and common. The handle, though, was really curious. It was of wood and carved to resemble an elephant's head. The long trunk of the elephant was curved to make a crook for the handle. The eyes of the beast were small red stones, and it had two tiny tusks of ivory.",

Cap'n Bill is also a new character who seems to have won approval, and so both Trot and the old sailor are again introduced in the present story, which may be called the second of the series of adventures of Trot and Cap'n Bill.",
