Rapidly, however, the weather takes a turn for the worse and an enormous storm develops, washing them overboard. Rescued by mermaids, they are taken to a nearby cave. Thereafter Cap'n Bill and Trot encounter a variety of characters: the strangely shaped, ostrich-like Ork; the Bumpy Man, who deals in sugar and molasses; and Button Bright, a young boy in a sailor's outfit who constantly gets lost. With the aid of some friendly birds and magical berries, the group is eventually carried safely across the deadly desert to Oz. However, things rapidly take a turn for the worse as the motley group finds themselves in Jinxland, a country riven by political intrigue and instability, and currently ruled by the infamous Krewl. Will Glinda be able to help depose the despot Krewl and save the lives of Cap'n Bill and the Princess?",

The old sailorman and the little girl are miraculously saved and regain consciousness to find themselves in a sea cavern. (To this day, Trot asserts she felt mermaid arms about her during those terrible moments under water.) They experience one perilous adventure after another until eventually they make their way to Jinxland and meet the Scarecrow who takes charge of things once Cap'n Bill is transformed into a tiny grasshopper with a wooden leg. Will the Captain remain a grasshopper or will Trot, the Scarecrow, and their friends be able to restore him to his former shape and life? Find out in the exciting conclusion of The Scarecrow of Oz.",

It was no easy task to obey this order and land Trot and Cap'n Bill safely in Oz, as you will discover by reading this book. Indeed, it required the best efforts of our dear old friend, the Scarecrow, to save them from a dreadful fate on the journey; but the story leaves them happily located in Ozma's splendid palace and Dorothy has promised me that Button-Bright and the three girls are sure to encounter, in the near future, some marvelous adventures in the Land of Oz, which I hope to be permitted to relate to you in the next Oz Book.",
