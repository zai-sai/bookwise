        "description": "Set in the 1930s at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary's death-row facility, The Green Mile is the riveting and tragic story of John Coffey, a giant, preternaturally gentle inmate condemned to death for the rape and murder of twin nine-year-old girls. It is a story narrated years later by Paul Edgecomb, the ward superintendent compelled to help every prisoner spend his last days peacefully and every man walk the green mile to execution with his humanity intact. Edgecomb has sent seventy-eight inmates to their date with \"old sparky,\" but he's never encountered one like Coffey -- a man who wants to die, yet has the power to heal. And in this place of ultimate retribution, Edgecomb discovers the terrible truth about Coffey's gift, a truth that challenges his most cherished beliefs -- and ours. Originally published in 1996 in six self-contained monthly installments, The Green Mile is an astonishingly rich and complex novel that delivers over and over again. Each individual volume became a huge success when first published, and all six were on the New York Times bestseller list simultaneously. Three years later, when Frank Darabont made The Green Mile into an award-winning movie starring Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, the book returned to the bestseller list -- and stayed there for months. And now -- with a new introduction by King's foreign agent Ralph Vicinanza, as well as the author's own foreword -- we have the first hardcover edition of this magnificent novel in which \"King surpasses our expectations, leaves us spellbound and hungry for the next twist of plot\" (The Boston Globe). With illustrations and a new frontispiece for this edition by Mark Geyer.",

Coffey on the Mile is Volume Six.Cold Mountain Penitentiary has seen its share of men drawing their last breaths, with many of them claiming to be innocent until the very end. In this final chapter of the six-part novel, we learn both John Coffey's fate and the terrible truth Paul Edgecombe discovers about him. The story also brings us farther into the present as Paul recounts the events of his life after Cold Mountain-and the lives of all he encountered there. The gentle giant with healing hands. The little mouse that softened a murderer's heart. The corrupt man capable of more evil than any of those he guarded. And all the wonderful and horrible men and moments in that place of ultimate retribution, the well-worn stretch of linoleum they called the Green Mile.",
