Thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantes is confined to the grim fortress of the island prison, Chateau d'If. He survives years of cramped confinement and eventually befriends another prisoner, an Italian who knows the location of a vast treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. After an intrepid escape, Dantès makes plans to unearth the treasure, become a count, and use his new found wealth to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. “The Count of Monte Cristo” is an ageless tale of adventure filled with revenge, mercy, courage, and hope. It endures as one of the classics of world literature, and is one of Alexandre Dumas’ most loved stories.",

Alexandre Dumas (1802–1870) also known as Alexandre Dumas, père, was a French writer. His works have been translated into nearly 100 languages, and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Riveting tale of romantic rivalries, struggles for power, daring escapes, clever disguises, buried treasure, and solemn promises. What more could an adventurous reader desire? Dumas's hero Edmond Dantes is a man on a mission, tasked with delivering a letter whose contents he does not know, but whose impact, when discovered by the wrong man, could be deadly. Thrown into a dangerous chain of events, Dantes must face his fate alone, forced to rely on his wits, courage, and a strong dose of good luck as he seeks justice against those whose greed and wickedness nearly cost him his life. A story so evil, so clever, and so violent that future reads will just be boring. To seek justice for the three men who so selfishly stole 14 years of his life, Edmund Dantes uses deception to emotionally and financially destroy his foes.",
