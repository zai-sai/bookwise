        "description": "In this exciting children’s story from the Oz series, a young Munchkin ventures to the Emerald City with the help of a live patchwork doll. Ojo the Unlucky isn’t sure how he got his nickname, but he finds it fitting after a visit to Dr. Pipt the Crooked Magician. There, he learns about Dr. Pipt’s incredible Powder of Life, which has turned an old patchwork quilt into a living girl. But when Dr. Pipt’s Liquid of Petrification accidentally turns Ojo’s uncle into a statue, Ojo must seek out the magic ingredients that will bring Unc Nunkie back to life. On his journey to the Emerald City to find a six-leaved clover, Ojo is joined by an arrogant Glass Cat, a four-legged Woozy, the resourceful Shaggy Man, and the Patchwork Girl herself. Along the way, Ojo meets a thoughtful Scarecrow, a caring Tin Woodman, and a kind young lady from Kansas named Dorothy Gale. And while gathering the life-saving ingredients isn’t easy, his adventures might just teach him that luck is what you make of it.",
