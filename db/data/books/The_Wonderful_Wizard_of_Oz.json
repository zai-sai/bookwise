Frank Baum's classic tale has endured and grown, embraced by generation after generation of children and the young at heart. To honour the centennial of its publication in 1900, the University Press of Kansas is presenting this special anniversary edition that combines Baum's original text with the contributions of two renowned artists: book illustrator Michael McCurdy and writer Ray Bradbury. The book embraces and celebrates the oft-kidded connection between Baum's wondrous story and the state of Kansas.",

The book is one of the best-known stories in American literature and has been widely translated. The Library of Congress has declared it \"America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale.\" Its groundbreaking success, and that of the Broadway musical adapted from the novel led Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books that serve as official sequels to the first story.In January 1901, George M. Hill Company completed printing the first edition, a total of 10,000 copies, which quickly sold out. It had sold three million copies by the time it entered the public domain in 1956.",

It has since seen several reprints, most often under the title The Wizard of Oz, which is the title of the popular 1902 Broadway musical adaptation as well as the iconic 1939 musical film adaptation.The story chronicles the adventures of a young farm girl named Dorothy in the magical Land of Oz, after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their Kansas home by a cyclone.[nb 1] The novel is one of the best-known stories in American literature and has been widely translated. The Library of Congress has declared it \"America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale\". Its groundbreaking success and the success of the Broadway musical adapted from the novel led Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books that serve as official sequels to the first story.",

This richly illustrated book contains many rare photographs, film stills, sketches, theater programs, and movie advertisements from the different productions. Piecing together the Chicago and Broadway stage productions (1902-3) from contemporary reviews, surviving script pages, and published song lyrics, Swartz shows how Baum and his many collaborators worked to transform the book into a popular theatrical attraction -- often requiring significant alterations to the original story.",
