        "description": "Biggers had always been interested in mystery fiction, but his interest in Hawaii clearly stems from a 1919 vacation in Honolulu. While there, he read a newspaper article on a Chinese detective named Chang Apana. Apana would become the model for Charlie Chan in Biggers' 1925 novel, House Without a Key, and there quickly followed five more Charlie Chan novels. Fifty Candles -- first published in the Saturday Evening Post, just two years after that 1919 vacation -- shows how Hawaii, China, and murder had already begun to come together in Biggers' imagination. The story starts in a courthouse in Honolulu, moves to China, then to fog-shrouded San Francisco. Many of the elements used in the Charlie Chan series are present: Chinese characters (both sinister and sympathetic), the Honolulu legal system, a shrewd detective (in this case, the lawyer Mark Drew rather than a policemen), and a baffling murder complete with red herrings and plenty of suspects. Though Fifty Candles is a murder mystery, it is also a romance, with the romantic elements at times in the forefront. Mostly, though, it is a book that will delight Biggers' many fans as they trace the origins of Charlie Chan.",

Henry Drew has cheated young Winthrop out of a partnership in a Hunan mine. Other shady deeds abound in the past of this rich and outwardly respectable old man. Despite his antagonism to Drew, Winthrop accepts the old man's invitation to a birthday dinner, mainly to be near the young woman he loves, companion to Mrs. Drew. Unfortunately Winthrop finds old Drew dead in a pool of blood by the dining room table, and he himself is the likeliest suspect. Or could the murderer be Dr. Parker, illicit admirer of Mrs. Drew? And why are there fifty candles on the birthday cake, when old Drew was pushing seventy?",

        "description": "In \"The Canon in Residence,\" Victor L. Whitechurch delivers a masterful British mystery that intricately weaves elements of intrigue and suspense within a richly detailed narrative. The novel follows the adventures of Canon H. D. Drelincourt, who becomes embroiled in a series of perplexing crimes that disrupt the tranquility of the fictional English village of Broadisle. Whitechurch employs a stylistic approach reminiscent of classic detective fiction, characterized by a strong focus on character development and psychological depth, creating an atmosphere that invites readers to engage in the intricacies of deductive reasoning and moral dilemmas. This work not only showcases a well-crafted plot but also reflects the interwar period's fascination with the psychological nuances of human behavior within a deceptively serene backdrop. Victor L. Whitechurch, an author and clergyman, drew upon his extensive background in ecclesiastical settings and his experiences within the British social system to frame his narratives with authenticity. Coupled with his personal passion for detective fiction, these influences shaped \"The Canon in Residence\" into a different exploration of morality and justice, elevating it beyond a mere whodunit to a commentary on human nature. His prior works, steeped in the messiness of moral complexities, further illuminate his motivations for creating a layered mystery. Readers interested in the classic mystery genre will find \"The Canon in Residence\" to be a compelling addition to their shelves. Whitechurch's engaging style, combined with his keen understanding of character and motivation, makes this novel not just a gripping whodunit, but also a thoughtful exploration of the ethical questions surrounding crime and punishment. It's a must-read for aficionados of British mystery classics, inviting them to ponder the delicate interplay of faith, morality, and justice.",
