        "description": "In \"An American Tragedy,\" Theodore Dreiser weaves a compelling narrative that delves deeply into the themes of aspiration, morality, and the harsh realities of the American Dream. The novel follows the plight of Clyde Griffiths, a young man torn between his desires for wealth and status and the moral dilemmas they engender. Written in a naturalistic style, Dreiser utilizes vivid detail and psychological insight, portraying the societal pressures that shape individual destiny. Set against the backdrop of early 20th-century America, the novel reflects a world governed by the relentless pursuit of success, intertwining personal ambition with tragic consequences. Theodore Dreiser, a pivotal figure in American literature, draws on his own experiences of poverty and social upheaval to explore the complexities of human desire. Growing up in a struggling family amid the bustling backdrop of industrial America, Dreiser's observations of class disparity and ethical ambiguity fueled his literary pursuits. His background instilled in him a profound understanding of the human condition, particularly the darker impulses that inform our choices. \"An American Tragedy\" is highly recommended for readers seeking a profound exploration of ambition and the moral compromises it often entails. Dreiser's work remains essential reading for those interested in understanding the social fabric of America, as well as the timeless struggles of the human spirit.",

        "description": "An American Tragedy is a tour de force, one of the most important novels in the American cannon. Ripped from the headlines, it follows Clyde Griffiths, a handsome, ambitious man whose religious upbringing has left him unprepared to pay the price required to realize the American Dream. It's an ambitious novel that unflinchingly confronts the lie of the American Dream and myth of a classless society with opportunities for all, and an extraordinary crime novel that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page. Nothing short of monumental.-- Kirkus The naturalist author Theodore Dreiser was obsessed with true crime, keeping track of articles and cases in the early 20th century. The product of this obsession was his 1925 novel, \"An American Tragedy\", based on a true crime story from New York's Adirondack Mountains region that Dreiser followed. This novel was one of Dreiser's most successful works and has often been hailed as his masterpiece.",

        "description": "“An American Tragedy” by Theodore Dreiser is a sweeping and poignant exploration of the life of Clyde Griffiths, a young man caught in the web of his own desires, ambitions, and the rigid societal structures of early 20th-century America. The novel opens with a depiction of Clyde’s family, a group of street preachers whose lives are marked by fervent religious devotion and a stark lack of material success. The family, led by the stern and emotionally inept Asa Griffiths and his more steadfast wife, is presented as an “anomaly of psychic and social reflex and motivation,” highlighting the complex interplay of environment and personal disposition that shapes individual destinies. The children, including a young Clyde, are reluctantly obedient to their parents’ strict religious practices, their lack of enthusiasm foreshadowing Clyde’s eventual rebellion.",

It was based on the notorious murder of Grace Brown in 1906 and the trial of her lover.

        "description": "An American Tragedy (1925) is a novel by the American writer Theodore Dreiser. Plot summary : Ambitious but ill-educated, naïve, and immature Clyde Griffiths is raised by poor and devoutly religious parents to help in their street missionary work. As a young adult, Clyde must, to help support his family, take menial jobs as a soda jerk, then a bellhop at a prestigious Kansas City hotel. There, his more sophisticated colleagues introduce him to bouts of social drinking and sex with some of the hotel's female guests and with prostitutes.Enjoying his new lifestyle, Clyde becomes infatuated with Hortense Briggs, who inveigles Clyde into buying her an expensive jacket. When Clyde learns Hortense desires his colleague Sparser, not himself, as a lover, he becomes jealous. Hortense repeatedly tells Clyde that she loves him while getting him to buy her the jacket (for which they are overcharged by a stereotypically greedy Jewish shopkeeper).Clyde's life changes dramatically when Sparser, driving Clyde, Hortense and other friends back from a secluded rendezvous in the country in a stolen car, hits a little girl and kills her. Fleeing from the police at high speed, Sparser crashes the car. Everyone but Sparser and his partner flee the scene of the crime. Clyde leaves Kansas City, fearing prosecution as an accessory to Sparser's crimes. This pattern of personal irresponsibility and panicked decision-making in Clyde's life recurs in the story, culminating in the central tragedy of the novel.While working as a bellboy at an exclusive club in Chicago, he meets his wealthy uncle Samuel Griffiths, the owner of a shirt-collar factory in the fictional city of Lycurgus, New York. Samuel, feeling guilt for neglecting his poor relations, offers to help Clyde if he will come to Lycurgus. When Clyde accepts the offer, his uncle gives Clyde a menial job at the factory, in which Clyde makes a very good showing. After that, Samuel Griffiths gives his nephew Clyde a minor supervisory job at the collar factory's offices.Samuel Griffiths' son Gilbert, Clyde's immediate supervisor, makes it clear to Clyde that as a Griffiths, he should not consort with the working people of Lycurgus, and specifically not with the women under his supervision. As Clyde has no close friends in Lycurgus, he becomes lonely. Emotionally vulnerable, Clyde is drawn to Roberta Alden, a poor and innocent farm girl working in his office, who falls in love with him. Clyde secretly courts Roberta, ultimately persuading her to have sex with him rather than lose him, and makes her pregnant.At the same time this is happening, elegant young socialite Sondra Finchley, daughter of another Lycurgus factory owner, takes an interest in Clyde despite his cousin Gilbert's efforts to keep them apart. Clyde's engaging manner makes him popular among the young smart set of Lycurgus, he and Sondra become close, and he courts her as well as Roberta. Roberta expects Clyde to marry her to avert the shame of an unwed pregnancy, but Clyde now dreams instead of marrying Sondra.Having failed to procure an abortion for Roberta, Clyde doesn't give her more than desultory help with living expenses while his relationship with Sondra matures. When Roberta threatens to reveal her relationship with Clyde unless he marries her, he reluctantly plans to murder her by drowning while they go boating, having read a local newspaper report of a similar boating accident.Clyde takes Roberta out in a canoe on Big Moose Lake in upstate New York and rows to a secluded bay. As he speaks to her regarding the end of their relationship, Roberta moves towards him, and he unintentionally strikes her in the face with a camera, stunning her and accidentally capsizing the boat. Roberta, unable to swim, drowns while Clyde, unwilling to save her, swims to shore. The narrative implies that the blow was accidental, but the trail of circumstantial evidence left by the panicky and guilt-ridden Clyde points to mu",
