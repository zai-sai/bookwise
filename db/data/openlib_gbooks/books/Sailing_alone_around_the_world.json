        "description": "First published in 1900, \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" is the detailed account of how Joshua Slocum would become the first person to circumnavigate the globe by himself. Aboard a sloop named the 'Spray', which Slocum himself rebuilt and refitted, he would depart from Boston on April, 24th, 1895 on this remarkable journey. Over the course of the next three years the boat would take him to Gloucester, Nova Scotia, Azores, Gibraltar, Morocco, the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Islands, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Maldonado, Montevideo, through the Strait of Magellan, through the Cockburn Channel, Port Angosto, Juan Fernandez, Marquesas, Samoa, Fiji, Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania, Cooktown, Christmas Island, Keeling Cocos, Rodrigues, Mauritius, Durban, Cape Town, Transvaal, St Helena, Ascension Island, Devil's Island, Trinidad, Grenada, Newport, and finally back to Fairhaven in Massachusetts. Filled with numerous illustrations, \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" is a real-life nautical tale of adventure filled with perilous encounters and challenges. A classic story of self-determination, \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" has inspired generations of sailors and adventurers alike ever since its original publication. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper.",

On the northern slope of the range grows the hardy spruce-tree, well adapted for ship-timbers, of which many vessels of all classes have been built. The people of this coast, hardy, robust, and strong, are disposed to compete in the world's commerce, and it is nothing against the master mariner if the birthplace mentioned on his certificate be Nova Scotia. I was born in a cold spot, on coldest North Mountain, on a cold February 20, though I am a citizen of the United States—a naturalized Yankee, if it may be said that Nova Scotians are not Yankees in the truest sense of the word. On both sides my family were sailors; and if any Slocum should be found not seafaring, he will show at least an inclination to whittle models of boats and contemplate voyages. My father was the sort of man who, if wrecked on a desolate island, would find his way home, if he had a jack-knife and could find a tree. He was a good judge of a boat, but the old clay farm which some calamity made his was an anchor to him. He was not afraid of a capful of wind, and he never took a back seat at a camp-meeting or a good, old-fashioned revival.",
