His public reputation is flawless yet privately he leads an immoral life, frequenting squalid opium dens. And although outwardly he seems delighted with the betrothal of his nephew Edwin Drood to Rosa Bud, one of his choristers, secretly he is consumed by jealousy. But he is not alone in hoping for Edwin's demise. Among others, hot-tempered Neville Landless has also made an enemy of Drood - so when Edwin disappears, at whom should the accusing finger point?",

The next evening, Edwin Drood visits Jasper, who is the choirmaster at Cloisterham Cathedral. Edwin confides that he has misgivings about his betrothal to Rosa Bud. The next day, Edwin visits Rosa at the Nuns' House, the boarding school where she lives. They quarrel good-naturedly, which they apparently do frequently during his visits. Meanwhile, Jasper, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, seeks the company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone else.",

        "description": "Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens . The biggest mystery of The Mystery of Edwin Drood is how it ends. It began as a serial, as nearly all of Dickens' novels did, but only six instalments were published before the author's death in 1870. What we know about Edwin Drood is this: he is betrothed to a young woman named Rosa Bud; they are fond of each other, but uncertain about their future together. Jasper John-Edwin's older uncle and a frequenter of London's opium dens-is infatuated with Rosa, as is Neville Landless, and the two begin to compete for her affection behind the scenes. Then, on Christmas Eve, Drood disappears, leaving behind only a pin and a pocket watch. What became of Edwin Drood that fateful night is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in literature and it continues to intrigue readers, writers, and literary historians more than 100 years after Dickens' death.",
