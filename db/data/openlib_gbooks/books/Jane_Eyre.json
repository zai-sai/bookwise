        "description": "Jane Eyre, the story of a young girl and her passage into adulthood, was an immediate commercial success at the time of its original publication in 1847. Its representation of the underside of domestic life and the hypocrisy behind religious enthusiasm drew both praise and bitter criticism, while Charlotte Brontë's striking expose of poor living conditions for children in charity schools as well as her poignant portrayal of the limitations faced by women who worked as governesses sparked great controversy and social debate. Jane Eyre, Brontë's best-known novel, remains an extraordinary coming-of-age narrative, and one of the great classics of literature.",

        "description": "Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte Following the life story of one Jane Eyre, the novel by the same name was written by Charlotte Bronte in 1847. The tale of the young woman gives great insight and depth to the troubles of the times, as many of the life events are based off of the author's real life experiences. From abusive family and schooling to heartbreak and marriage, the tale of Jane Eyre truly displays the tragedies and victories of a completely different time period. The young girl finds herself living with an aunt and her children, all of which are very abusive to young Jane and school is no escape. Attending Lowood school, Jane experiences the hard hand of headmaster Brocklehurts and the cruelty of their disciplinary beliefs. During her time at Lowood, her only friend dies due to the conditions of the school, much like the author's own two sisters died of tuberculosis during their very harsh schooling experiences. But Jane's heartache doesn't end there. Swooning for a married man, Jane goes through ups and downs during different relationships and stages of her life. Growing terribly ill and losing all of her money, she reaches a low point in her adult life, but she receives a stroke of fortune that leads her to the life she's always wanted. The heart wrenching tale takes the reader through a roller coaster of emotions as a passionate author creates the ultimate tribute to her own life experiences. Using powerful words that provoke emotion and feeling, the unique story of Jane Eyre presents an array of lessons and insights that a reader determines for themselves. Taking a glimpse back into the times of the 1820's, the novel is an absolute must read for any history or tragedy loving reader. About The Author Charlotte Bronte was an English novelist and poet towards the end of her life. As she grew up, the young woman was at one point a teacher at the very school she had previously studied at, and also spent a couple years as a governess. Charlotte decided to tell her unique story through the fictional character of Jane Eyre, and later wrote two other novels as well. Dying at the young age of 38, Charlotte Bronte never got to experience the fame of her works. She is now considered one of the most notable Victorian women novelists. Through the heartache, misfortunes and occasional successes, the tale of Jane Eyre allows the life and reputation of Charlotte Bronte to live on till this day. Written for those who love to read, listen to a good story and find themselves absorbed into the tales of the past, Jane Eyre is a must read for every novel enthusiast. The unique tale provides life lessons, guidance, and eye opening viewpoints to any reader that is ready to uncover and receive such underlying messages.

        "description": "Charlotte Bronte (21 April 1816 - 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Bronte sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels have become classics of English literature. The literary heritage of the Bronte sisters entered the treasury of national English culture gaining recognition far beyond England. Particular success fell on the novel written by Charlotte Bronte 'Jane Eyre' which was subsequently filmed. Written with sincerity and passion, the novel does not age and does not lose its charm. 'Jane Eyre' is still one of the most popular classical works of the XIX century. The strength of his influence lies in the truth of the senses, in their truth, in the combination of the real with the romantic, in the captivating fascination of history, a simple little governess capable of great and faithful love, having managed, having overcome all the vicissitudes of fate in order to find her own happiness.",

        "description": "How is this book unique? Font adjustments & biography included Unabridged (100% Original content) Illustrated About Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë Jane Eyre is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published on 16 October 1847, by Smith, Elder & Co. of London, England, under the pen name \"Currer Bell.\" The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York. Primarily of the bildungsroman genre, Jane Eyre follows the emotions and experiences of its title character, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester, the Byronic master of fictitious Thornfield Hall. In its internalisation of the action--the focus is on the gradual unfolding of Jane's moral and spiritual sensibility, and all the events are coloured by a heightened intensity that was previously the domain of poetry--Jane Eyre revolutionised the art of fiction. Charlotte Brontë has been called the 'first historian of the private consciousness' and the literary ancestor of writers like Joyce and Proust. The novel contains elements of social criticism, with a strong sense of morality at its core, but is nonetheless a novel many consider ahead of its time given the individualistic character of Jane and the novel's exploration of classism, sexuality, religion, and proto-feminism.",
