Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someones been signaling with candles from the mansions windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?",

Before the novel begins, Sir Charles Baskerville had died suddenly, perhaps the victim of a ghostly hound believed to haunt his family because of an age-old curse. The Baskerville estate is located out in the remote moor of Devonshire.Holmes and Watson are introduced to the case by Dr. Mortimer, a friend of Sir Charles Baskerville. Mortimer believes that a hound has in fact killed Sir Charles, because he found a paw print near Sir Charles's corpse. He is worried that there may be some truth to the superstitious legend, which is detailed in an old manuscript, and thus approaches Holmes in hopes that the detective can protect Sir Henry, who is soon to arrive to claim the family estate and fortune.When Sir Henry arrives in London, he exhibits no fear of the old legend. Instead, he insists on leaving soon for Baskerville Hall. However, several strange things happen while he is in London: an anonymous letter arrives, warning him to stay away from the moor; two boots are stolen from his hotel, each from a different pair; and Holmes observes a bearded man following him around the city. Certain that something insidious is afoot, Holmes sends Watson to Devonshire, where he is to accompany and protect Sir Henry while Holmes wraps up some business in London.",

Originally serialised in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902, it is set largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and tells the story of an attempted murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin. Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson investigate the case. This was the first appearance of Holmes since his intended death in \"The Final Problem\", and the success of The Hound of the Baskervilles led to the character's eventual revival.At Baskerville Hall on the grim moors of Devonshire, a legendary curse has apparently claimed one more victim. Sir Charles Baskerville has been found dead. There are no signs of violence, but his face is hideously distorted with terror. Years earlier, a hound-like beast with blazing eyes and dripping jaws was reported to have torn out the throat of Hugo Baskerville. Has the spectral destroyer struck again? More important, is Sir Henry Baskerville, younger heir to the estate, now in danger?Enter Sherlock Holmes, summoned to protect Sir Henry from the fate that has threatened the Baskerville family. As Holmes and Watson begin to investigate, a blood-chilling howl from the fog-shrouded edges of the great Grimpen Mire signals that the legendary hound of the Baskervilles is poised for yet another murderous attack.",

        "description": "The Baskerville Hound, also translated as The Baskerville Dog or The Baskerville Mastiff, is the third novel by Arthur Conan Doyle which has as main protagonist Sherlock Holmes. It was published by installments in The Strand Magazine between 1901 and 1902. The novel is mainly set in Dartmoor, in Devon, a county of the west of England. Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning from South Africa, where he had worked as a medical volunteer at The Langman Field Hospital in Bloemfontein. He was assisted in the plot by a 30-year-old journalist from the Daily Express named Bertram Fletcher Robinson (1870-1907). His ideas come from the legend of Richard Cabell, who was the inspiration of the legend of the Baskerville. His tomb can be seen in a village called Buckfastleigh.Richard Cabell lived during the 1600s and was the local squire at Buckfastleigh. He had a passion for hunting and was what in those days described himself as a \"monstrously evil man.\" He gained this reputation for, among other things, his immorality and for having sold his soul to the devil. It was also rumored that he had murdered his wife. On July 5, 1677 he died and was buried in his tomb, but that was only the beginning of the story. On the night of his burial, a dog-shaped ghost appeared all around the moor and howled in his grave. Since that night, you can find the ghost, usually on the anniversary of his death. If he does not go hunting, it is possible to find him in his grave howling and screaming.Conan Doyle's description of Baskerville Hall was inspired by a visit to Cromer Hall in Norfolk. Some elements of the story were inspired by a stay at the Real Links Hotel in Cromer, where Conan Doyle heard for the first time the story of Black Shuck, the ghost dog from the Cromer area, who is said to walk between Overstrand in East and East Runton in the west.When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead on a path in the wasteland of Devonshire, Dr. Mortimer comes to London to seek the help of Sherlock Holmes: he reads to Holmes the manuscript about the curse of the Baskerville, supposedly initiated with Hugo de Baskerville, killed by an infernal hound as punishment for his evil. After this, the doctor tells him about the bloodhound tracks found a short distance from the corpse. It also lets him know that he wishes to know his opinion, since the only heir of the Baskerville, Sir Henry, coming from the United States, was about to arrive in England to accept the inheritance (in addition to money, the mansion of the Baskervilles) and Dr. Mortimer did not know what to do with him, for he feared that what was supposed to have been a familiar legend was really truth, that is, he feared for the life of Sir Henry. Holmes replies that he is calm and will accompany the young heir all the time, not leaving him alone, while he is in charge of resolving the case. Later, Dr. Mortimer returned with Sir Henry, worried, because a mysterious letter came to them which contained cut-out words, except \"paramo\". The letter said: \"If you value your life or your sanity, you must keep away from the moor.\"",
