Indeed, I know of another that in some respects, at least, surpasses that in points of interest, and if you will promise not to inquire into the real names of the parties concerned, as the affair is a secret, I will relate you my experience regarding it.\" Anna Green was an early 20th century novelist. She was one of the first authors to write detective stories in America. Her stories are known for their well thought out plots and their legal accuracy. Although Green wrote in a genre previously dominated by men she did n think much of feminists and opposed women's suffrage. Her second novel A Strange Disappearance was published in 1880.",

She was one of the first writers of detective fiction in America and distinguished herself by writing well plotted, legally accurate stories. Green has been called \"the mother of the detective novel She was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 11, 1846. Green had an early ambition to write romantic verse, and she corresponded with Ralph Waldo Emerson. When her poetry failed to gain recognition, she produced her first and best known novel, The Leavenworth Case (1878), praised by Wilkie Collins, and the hit of the year. She became a bestselling author, eventually publishing about 40 books. On November 25, 1884, Green married the actor and stove designer, and later noted furniture maker, Charles Rohlfs (1853 - 1936), who was seven years her junior. Rohlfs toured in a dramatization of Green's The Leavenworth Case. After his theater career faltered, he became a furniture maker in 1897, and Green collaborated with him on some of his designs. Together they had one daughter and two sons: Rosamund Rohlfs, Roland Rohlfs, and Sterling Rohlfs. Green died on April 11, 1935 in Buffalo, New York, at the age of 88",

        "description": "Anna Katharine Green was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 11th, 1846. Anna's initial ambition was to be a poet. However that path failed to ignite any significant interest and she turned to fiction writing. She published her first - and most famous work in 1878 - 'The Leavenworth Case'. Wilkie Collins praised it and it sold extremely well It led to Anna writing 40 novels and to becoming known as 'the mother of the detective novel.' In helping to shape the genre she brought many other innovations including a series detective: her main character was detective Ebenezer Gryce of the New York Metropolitan Police Force, but in three novels he is assisted by the nosy society spinster Amelia Butterworth, another innovation and a prototype for Miss Marple, Miss Silver and others. She also invented the 'girl detective': in the character of Violet Strange, a debutante with a secret life as a sleuth. Anna's other innovations included the now familiar dead bodies in libraries, newspaper clippings as \"clews,\" the coroner's inquest, and expert witnesses. Yale Law School once used her books to demonstrate how damaging it can be to rely on circumstantial evidence. Her career was now well advanced and she was much admired. On November 25, 1884, Green married the actor and stove designer, and later noted furniture maker, Charles Rohlfs, who was seven years her junior. They had three children; Rosamund, Roland and Sterling. Although Anna was a progressive she did not approve of many of her feminist contemporaries, and was opposed to women's suffrage. On November 25, 1884, Anna married the actor and noted furniture maker, Charles Rohlfs, who was seven years her junior. They had three children; Rosamund, Roland and Sterling. Anna Katharine Green died on April 11, 1935 in Buffalo, New York, at the age of 88.",

Green has been called \"the mother of the detective novel\" Life and work: She was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 11, 1846.

She became a bestselling author, eventually publishing about 40 books. On November 25, 1884, Green married the actor and stove designer, and later noted furniture maker, Charles Rohlfs (1853 - 1936), who was seven years her junior.Rohlfs toured in a dramatization of Green's The Leavenworth Case. After his theater career faltered, he became a furniture maker in 1897, and Green collaborated with him on some of his designs. Together they had one daughter and two sons: Rosamund Rohlfs, Roland Rohlfs, and Sterling Rohlfs. Her daughter Rosamund married Robert Twitty Palmer.
