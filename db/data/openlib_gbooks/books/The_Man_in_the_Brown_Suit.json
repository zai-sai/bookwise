        "description": "The Man in the Brown Suit Agatha Christie - Pretty, young Anne came to London looking for adventure. In fact, adventure comes looking for her—and finds her immediately at Hyde Park Corner tube station. Anne is present on the platform when a thin man, reeking of mothballs, loses his balance and is electrocuted on the rails. The Scotland Yard verdict is accidental death. But Anne is not satisfied. After all, who was the man in the brown suit who examined the body? And why did he race off, leaving a cryptic message behind: \"17-122 Kilmorden Castle\"? Mystery? Intrigue? Romance? The Man in the Brown Suit has it all. It's a thrilling adventure featuring young heroine, Anne Beddingfield. Anne witnesses a mysterious death in London and throws herself head-first into the investigation, travelling to South Africa. While following Anne's quest for the truth, we meet several interesting personalities, from a well-meaning socialite to a mysterious dancer, to the bright former spy, Colonel Race, who will reappear in later novels by Christie.",

But she stumbles upon more than she bargained for! Anne is on the platform at Hyde Park Corner tube station when a man falls onto the live track, dying instantly.

Lovely Anne is the last person on earth suited to solve this mystery... and the only one who can!
