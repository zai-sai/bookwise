        "description": "How is this book unique? Font adjustments & biography included Unabridged (100% Original content) Illustrated About The Damned by Algernon Blackwood The Damned by Algernon Blackwood is a great haunted house story along the lines of Turn of the Screw and the Haunting of Hill House. A brother and sister spend some time with a recently widowed friend. Her deceased husband was a strict fire and brimstone preacher who damned everyone who didn't believe like him to hell. His less strong-willed wife fell under his spell, but now the house seems to be haunted by...a shadow? Goblins? Ghostly pagans? Or many different things at once. This is a suspenseful, gripping tale about the tyranny of closed mindedness disguised as a horror novel.",

        "description": "In \"The Damned,\" Algernon Blackwood crafts an enthralling tale that explores the uneasy boundaries between the natural and the supernatural, employing his signature style of atmospheric prose infused with deep psychological insights. The narrative examines themes of isolation, fear, and the haunting presence of the unknown, set against the backdrop of a desolate wilderness that mirrors the protagonists' inner turmoil. Blackwood's evocative descriptions and suspenseful pacing reflect the literary trends of early 20th-century supernatural fiction, positioning the work alongside contemporaries like M.R. James and H.P. Lovecraft, while retaining a unique focus on the spiritual dimensions of human experience. Algernon Blackwood, a member of the influential group of writers in the early 1900s fascinated by nature and the occult, drew from his diverse experiences as a journalist, outdoorsman, and explorer. His lifelong fascination with the mysteries of existence and the allure of the natural world informs the eerie and immersive quality of his storytelling. \"The Damned\" is a testament to his belief in the power of the unseen, revealing the complex interplay between humanity and the extraterrestrial. This unabridged edition of \"The Damned\" invites readers to journey into Blackwood's psychologically rich terrain, where the lines between reality and the extraordinary blur. It is a must-read for those who appreciate deep psychological narratives, rich descriptions, and thought-provoking themes, making it a sublime addition to the library of any lover of supernatural literature.",

        "description": "This book edition of \"The Damned\" has been formatted to the highest digital standards and adjusted for readability on all devices. Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951) was an English short story writer and novelist, one of the most prolific writers of ghost stories in the history of the genre. Blackwood wrote a number of horror stories. His most work seeks less to frighten than to induce a sense of awe. Excerpt: \"Certain things, however, gradually then became apparent, forcing themselves upon me. They came slowly, but overwhelmingly. Not that facts had changed, or natural details altered in the grounds--this was impossible--but that I noticed for the first time various aspects I had not noticed before--trivial enough, yet for me, just then, significant. Some I remembered from previous days; others I saw now as I wandered to and fro, uneasy, uncomfortable,--almost, it seemed, watched by some one who took note of my impressions. The details were so foolish, the total result so formidable. I was half aware that others tried hard to make me see. It was deliberate. My sister's phrase, 'one layer got at me, another gets at you,' flashed, undesired, upon me.\"",

You could work here to your heart's content. Mabel quite understands, and says she would love to have you when you feel free to come. She has changed a bit--back to her old natural self: she never mentions him. The place has changed too in certain ways: it has more cheerfulness, I think. She has put it in, this cheerfulness, spaded it in, if you know what I mean; but it lies about uneasily and is not natural--quite. The organ is a beauty. She must be very rich now, but she's as gentle and sweet as ever. Do you know, Bill, I think he must have frightened her into marrying him. I get the impression she was afraid of him.\" This last sentence was inked out, I but I read it through the scratching; the letters being too big to hide. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public.
