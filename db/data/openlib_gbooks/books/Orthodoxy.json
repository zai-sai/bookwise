        "description": "\"One of the top 10 Christian books of the twentieth century.\" --Christianity Today Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) has been called \"the ablest and most exuberant proponent of orthodox Christianity of his time.\" One of the twentieth century's most thoughtful authors, he greatly influenced countless Christian writers including C.S. Lewis and others. Described as one of 10 \"indispensable spiritual classics\" of the past 1500 years byPublishers Weekly, Chesterton's Orthodoxy offers a unique explanation of the essentials of the Christian faith, and of his own journey from skepticism to belief. \"It is constantly assumed, especially in our Tolstoian tendencies, that when the lion lies down with the lamb the lion becomes lamb-like. . . . That is simply the lamb absorbing the lion instead of the lion eating the lamb. The real problem is--can the lion lie down with the lamb and still retain his royal ferocity? That is the problem the Church attempted; that is the miracle she achieved.\" --from Orthodoxy Every Christian library needs the classics--the timeless books that have spoken powerfully to generations of believers. Hendrickson Christian Classics allow readers to build an essential classics library in affordable modern editions. Each volume is freshly retypeset for reading comfort, while thoughtful new introductions place each in historical and spiritual context. Attractive, classically bound covers look great together on the shelf. Best of all, value pricing makes this series easy to own. Planned to span the spectrum of Christian wisdom through the ages, Hendrickson Christian Classics set a new standard for quality and value.",

        "description": "In \"Orthodoxy,\" G. K. Chesterton presents a compelling and articulate defense of Christianity, blending personal narrative with philosophical discourse. The book is structured as a series of essays that traverse his journey from skepticism to robust faith, marked by Chesterton's characteristic wit and paradoxical reasoning. His literary style is both engaging and accessible, utilizing vivid imagery and a conversational tone that invites the reader to ponder profound theological concepts while simultaneously enjoying the narrative flow. Set against the backdrop of early 20th-century thought, Chesterton critiques the contemporary philosophies of materialism and secularism, articulating a vibrant Christian worldview that remains relevant today. G. K. Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English writer, philosopher, and journalist known for his sharp intellect and playful approach to complex subjects. Influenced by personal struggles with faith and the philosophical dilemmas of his time, Chesterton sought to reconcile reason and spirituality. His background in journalism and literature equipped him with a unique ability to communicate profound truths in a manner that resonates with a wide audience, making \"Orthodoxy\" not just a theological treatise but also a work of literary art. For readers seeking an intellectual exploration of faith and reason, \"Orthodoxy\" is essential. Chesterton's arguments are both a challenge and an invitation, beckoning us to reconsider the foundations of belief amid a modern landscape often characterized by uncertainty. His insightful observations and passionate defense of faith will inspire those grappling with questions of meaning and purpose in a rapidly changing world.",

According to Chesterton, the purpose of Orthodoxy is to \"attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.\" With witty anecdotes and bulletproof logic, Chesterton lays out a neat and tidy defense of Christianity. The book is simultaneously immensely entertaining and packed with wisdom and truth. Up until now there has not been a standalone print edition that is well-designed and readily available. This ItB Classics edition features the public domain text of Orthodoxy, with new typesetting and a brand-new interior. Spacious margins make the book perfect for study notes and academic use. Orthodoxy is a part of the ItB Press \"Classics\" series.",

        "description": "Now with a foreword by Matthew Lee Anderson Antiquated. Unimaginative. Repressive. We've all heard these common reactions to orthodox Christian beliefs. Even Christians themselves are guilty of the tendency to discard historic Christianity. Yet as we read through the literature in Christianity’s past, we learn that we are in better company with our beliefs than we might think. Through his enchanting book, Orthodoxy, G.K. Chesterton reminds us of the paradoxes of our faith and the joy that comes when we explore them. From the foreword by Matthew Lee Anderson, author of The End of Our Exploring: “How can we contrive to be at once astonished at the world and yet at home in it?” And with that question, G.K. Chesterton recounts the heart of an intellectual journey that took him from the edges of a nihilistic pessimism into the center of the paradoxical joy of Christian orthodoxy. His book is not a defense of the Christian faith, at least not primarily, so much as an attempt to explain how the startling paradoxes and sharp edges of the creed explain everything else. It is a dated work, dealing in the categories and concerns of Chesterton’s contemporaries, and yet it comes nearer timelessness than anything we have today. Though Orthodoxy was written near the start of the 20th century, I have dubbed it the most important book for the 21st. There are few claims I have made in my life that I am more sure of than that one.",

        "description": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is a foundational work that explores the synthesis between Christian faith and philosophical reason within the context of medieval thought. Through the study of his life and writings, particularly the Summa Theologiae, it reveals a profound approach to ethical, metaphysical, and theological questions that defined the Scholastic tradition. The work highlights how Aquinas integrated Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine, shaping an intellectual framework that deeply influenced Western thought. Since its emergence, the figure of St. Thomas has been recognized for his logical rigor, clarity of argumentation, and his effort to harmonize faith and reason without subordinating one to the other. His views on being, natural law, and the ultimate purpose of human life remain central to philosophical and theological inquiry. The work endures for its invitation to critically reflect on morality, human freedom, and the role of reason in understanding the divine. The lasting relevance of Thomistic thought lies in its ability to address ethical and spiritual dilemmas from a rational and systematic perspective. By examining the relationship between humanity, God, and society, the work on St. Thomas Aquinas continues to offer intellectual tools for engaging with contemporary challenges through philosophical and spiritual depth.",

When some time ago I published a series of hasty but sincere papers, under the name of \"Heretics,\" several critics for whose intellect I have a warm respect (I may mention specially Mr. G.S.Street) said that it was all very well for me to tell everybody to affirm his cosmic theory, but that I had carefully avoided supporting my precepts with example. \"I will begin to worry about my philosophy,\" said Mr. Street, \"when Mr. Chesterton has given us his.\" It was perhaps an incautious suggestion to make to a person only too ready to write books upon the feeblest provocation. But after all, though Mr. Street has inspired and created this book, he need not read it. If he does read it, he will find that in its pages I have attempted in a vague and personal way, in a set of mental pictures rather than in a series of deductions, to state the philosophy in which I have come to believe. I will not call it my philosophy; for I did not make it. God and humanity made it; and it made me.",
