    "description": "Callahan\nI’m the Kane brother everyone gossips about behind closed doors.\nTrust fund brat. Washed-up athlete. High-functioning alcoholic.\nNo one knows the real me but her.\nLana Castillo—my childhood best friend and the only woman I ever loved.\nWhen I broke her heart six years ago, I promised to never return to Lake Wisteria. I kept my word until my grandfather’s will changed everything.\nTo receive my inheritance, I was tasked with spending a summer at the family lake house before selling it.\nThe request was simple in theory until my entire plan blew up on the very       first day.\nTurns out Lana doesn’t just live at the house, but she claims to own it, too.\n\nAlana\nFalling in love with Callahan Kane was a mistake.\nHe told me so before destroying my heart and our friendship six summers ago.\nWhen he promised never to come back, I foolishly believed him.\nBut then Cal showed up again, intending to sell his grandfather’s lake house.\nThe biggest flaw in his plan?\nMy name is on the deed.",
