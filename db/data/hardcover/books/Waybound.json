    "description": "Years ago, Lindon left his home as a powerless Unsouled. Now, he goes to war with the most powerful beings in the world over the future of Cradle itself.\n\nThe Weeping Dragon has a grudge to settle, and Lindon intends to take out the Dreadgod with his friends by his side. But rival Monarchs know his plans, and they won’t let things end so easily.\n\nIf Lindon does win, he will ascend to the heavens. But he may not find a safe haven there either.\n\nIn the worlds above, Suriel and Ozriel face off against the Mad King to determine the new shape of the cosmos. The victor will decide the fate of countless universes.\n\nWhether he wins or dies, Lindon will soon leave this life behind.\n\nThe time has come to say goodbye to Cradle.",
