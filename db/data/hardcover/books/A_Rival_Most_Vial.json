    "description": "Two potion shops, one heated rivalry...until hate bubbles over into something else.Any adventurer worth their sword knows about Ambrose Beake. The proud, quiet half-elf sells the best-and only-potions in the city.Until a handsome new shopkeeper named Eli opens another potion shop across the street, throwing Ambrose's peace and ledgers far off balance. Within weeks, they're locked in a war of price tags and products- Ambrose's expertise against Eli's effortless charm. Toil leads to trouble, the safety gloves come off, and right as their rivalry reaches a boiling point... The mayor commissions them to brew a potion together.The task is as complex as it is lucrative, pushing both men to the limits of their abilities and patience. Yet as the fires burn and cauldrons bubble...they find a different sort of chemistry brewing.",
