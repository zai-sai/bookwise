    "description": "Beautifully written . Very human, deeply spiritual. A book that resonates with life, it's struggles, its day to day routine that leads to introspection and encounters with God through simple people  in everyday events, in a struggle for sobriety. All these lead the protagonist to a the edge of darkness. Routine and struggle can do that to you . Instead of an abyss that you expect him plunge into he is in the end rescued by a loving, caring God. A God that manifests Himself in daily parochial life within a city' s catholic sector.  Author has spiritual depth and beautiful prose. I enjoyed this book very very much.",
