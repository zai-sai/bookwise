    "description": "\"Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. \n\nNow, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, becomes something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.\n\nExcept the discovery of their bond would mean the death of each of them. There’s still a war going on, after all. And someone has to win. That’s how war works, right?\"-- Provided by Amazon",
