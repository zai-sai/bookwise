    "description": "The Color Purple is a 1982 epistolary novel by American author Alice Walker which won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Award for Fiction.\r\n\r\nThe novel has been the frequent target of censors and appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2009 at number seventeenth because of the sometimes explicit content, particularly in terms of violence. In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's \"best-loved novels.\"\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAlso contained in:\r\n\r\n - [The Third Life of Grange Copeland / Meridian / The Color Purple][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18025207W/The_Third_Life_of_Grange_Copeland_Meridian_The_Color_Purple",
