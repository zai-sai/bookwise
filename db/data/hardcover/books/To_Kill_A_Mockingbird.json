    "description": "The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.\n\nCompassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.",
