    "description": "E-book exclusive extras: Christie biographer Charles Osborne's essay on Hallowe'en Party; \"The Poirots\": the complete guide to all the cases of the great Belgian detective.  Mystery writer Ariadne Oliver has been invited to a Hallowe’en party at Woodleigh Common. One of the other guests is an adolescent girl known for telling tall tales of murder and intrigue -- and for being generally unpleasant. But when the girl, Joyce, is found drowned in an apple-bobbing tub, Mrs Oliver wonders after the fictional nature of the girl’s claim that she had once witnessed a murder. Which of the party guests wanted to keep her quiet is a question for Ariadne’s friend Hercule Poirot. But unmasking a killer this Hallowe’en is not going to be easy -- for there isn’t a soul in Woodleigh who believes the late little storyteller was actually murdered.",
